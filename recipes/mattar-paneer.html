        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you will take all of the masala paste ingredients and add them to a grinder or a blender</li>
            <li>After that, you will grind the ingredients into a smooth paste. If needed add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water while grinding the masala paste. When the paste is creamy and blended to a fine consistency, set aside until later</li>
            <li>Next add 3 tablespoons oil in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Let the oil become hot. Reduce heat to a medium-low heat. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and fry until they splutter</li>
            <li>Next, add in your ground masala paste, and mix well</li>
            <li>Now you will sauté the paste mixture for about 10 to 12 minutes on a medium-low heat</li>
            <li>After sautéing the masala paste, add in all of the dry spice powders, stir to combine well and sauté for a minute</li>
            <li>Next, add in 1 cup of rinsed green peas or matar</li>
            <li>Mix again</li>
            <li>Then, add 1 to 1.25 cups water, salt and mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>It’s now time to pressure cook the green peas until they are fully cooked. Be sure to cover the cooker tightly, then cook for about 9 to 10 minutes or 2 to 3 whistles on medium to medium-high heat</li>
            <li> Finally, add the paneer cubes and mix well or simmer on a low heat for some seconds or until the paneer cubes are fully cooked. Don’t overcook as the paneer will become dense and hard</li>
            <li>Now that your matar paneer is ready to eat, garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot or warm</li>
